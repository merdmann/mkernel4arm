Object       Implemented   Description 
CPU:           Yes         the CPU on which the application runs under the control of
                           OSEK sub-systems.
OS:            Yes         the OSEK OS that runs on the CPU. No standard references are
                           defined in OIL from OSEK OS to other OIL objects.
APPMODE:       Yes         defines different modes of operation for the application. No
                           standard attributes are defined for the APPMODE object.
ISR:           No          interrupt service routines supported by the OS.
RESOURCE:      Yes         a resource that can be occupied by a task.
TASK:          Yes         a task handled by the OS.
COUNTER:       Yes         a counter represents hardware/software tick source for alarms.
EVENT:         Yes         an event tasks may react on.
ALARM:         Yes         an alarm is based on a counter and can either activate a task, set
                           an event or activate an alarm-callback routine.
COM:           No          the communication subsystem. The COM object has standard
                           attributes to define general properties for OSEK COM.
MESSAGE:       No 		   a message is defined in OSEK COM and defines the supplier-
                           specific attributes of a mechanism for data exchange between
                           different entities (entities being tasks or ISRs) and with other
                           CPUs.
NETWORKMESSAGE:No         a network message is defined in OSEK COM and defines the
                           OEM-specific attributes of a mechanism for data exchange
                           between different entities (entities being tasks or ISRs) and with
                           other CPUs.
IPDU:          No          an IPDU is defined in OSEK COM. IPDUs carry messages used
                           in external communication.
NM:            No          the network management subsystem.
